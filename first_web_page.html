<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>
Hope Squad is a community of high school committees that come together to give others hope and remind them they are loved.<br>
Students are voted by peers to choose those who will support and help others with challenges in and out of school.<br>
Hope Squad prioritizes mental and physical health while promoting long-term healthy habits.<br>
Our mission is to include everyone, reaching out regardless of differences.
