        <h2>What we Do</h2>
        <p>Hope Squad's team of students come together with the counselors of the school to collaborate different fun 
            <br>activites to do. This allows the students to see they are always available to talk together with. It also develops a bond 
            <br> between the students and the team, both benefitting by mutual happinness from socializing. From further observaions 
            <br>by Hope Squad members, their job is to keep everyone safe by recognizing signs and struggle in their peers, allowing 
            <br> trusted adults to step in.</p>
