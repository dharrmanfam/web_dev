    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
    Hope Squad is a community of highschool committees that come together to give others hope and remind them they are loved.<br>
    Numbers of people are voted by people of the school to pick those who will help them with their lives both in and out of school.<br>
    Hope Squad prioritizes people's mental and physical health, hoping to establish long term healthy habits for them.<br>
    Our mission is to include everyone and anyone, reaching out to all no matter how unique or different they are.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
    Hope Squad's team of students collaborates with school counselors to create enjoyable activities.<br>
    This helps students feel supported and builds connections between them and the team.<br>
    Hope Squad members also look for signs of struggle in their peers and alert trusted adults when needed.
