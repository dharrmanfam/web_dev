<!--CSS Basic Notes-->

<!--
What does CSS stand for?
    CSS: cascading style sheets

If I have the same thing written 2 times, which one will happen?
    The one that is inputted last.

What is a selector?
    A selector is a pattern used to target and select specific HTML elements for styling and 
    manipulation

Write out each of the 3 types of selectors
Type: element selector, class selector, id selector

Symbol needed: use element tag name, use period followed by class name, a hash followed by the ID name.

Examples: "p{                       .highlight{                             #main-header {
                color: blue             background-color: yellow;                  text-align: center;
                }"                  }                                       }


What is a declaration?
    A declaration is a line inside CSS that tells the browser how to style something.

What is a property?
    A property is the part of the declaration that you want to change. 

What is a value?
    The value is what you set the property to.

What is used instead of spaces?
    Hyphens are used instead of spaces in property names.

How do you center text?
    "text-align: center;"

What are the 3 ways to change color on a page? (the 3 different formats, not what can be changed)
    Color names- red, blue, green

    Hex codes- #ff5733

    RGB values- rgb(255, 87, 51)

Why would you not want to use a color's name to change the color? 
    Color name is not specific and not all systems render the same names.

Where can you find the specific colors you want?
    A color picker tool or other websites.

What are the different ways you can change the size of something? 
    px (pixels → fixed size)

    %- percentage → scales with the page

    em- based on font size

    rem- based on root font size

    vh/vw- viewport height/width units

Why would you want to set a size that automatically adjusts? 
    It would make it more easily accessible and convenient if it adapts and adjusts for many devices with different screens.
