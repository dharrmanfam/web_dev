        <p>I love icecream because it is soft, sweet, cold, and melts on my tongue. Its delectability can cheer me up anytime 
            <br> and reminds me of happy memories that happened in the past when I was a kid. Even though it can cause 
            <br> brain freezes when eaten too fast, the rush of delicious sweetness and creaminess makes up for it. Icecream 
            <br> is made with milk, cream, and sugar along with other flavorings. Icecream is perfect for any day, season, or 
            <br> weather with other customization that can be added to fulfill one's preferences!
